title: typing Swedish characters on a US keyboard
excerpt: I recently got my first US layout keyboard, a Nuphy Air75. The transition from a Swedish layout keyboard hasn't been too painful and programming feels easier as many of the brackets and things we use often are more conveniently placed and require fewer key presses.

I recently got my first US layout keyboard, a Nuphy Air75. The transition from a Swedish layout keyboard hasn't been too painful and programming feels easier as many of the brackets and things we use often are more conveniently placed and require fewer key presses.

However, I still need to switch between writing messages in Swedish and English. I've set up a shortcut in macOS to switch between Swedish and English as the input source (system settings -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> input sources -> "select the previous input source") but it feels cumbersome to use whenever I just need one Swedish character. So how would I type Swedish characters while keeping US as my input source?

- **å** is the easiest, `option + a`
- **ä** uses the umlaut accent, `option + u`, then `a`
- **ö** also uses the umlaut accent, `option + u`, then `o`
- **á** uses the acute accent, `option + e`, then `a` (this works the same for **é**, **í**, and **ó**)

To get capital letters, you use `shift` as you normally would when typing the actual letters, e.g., `option + u` then `shift + a` for **Ä**.
