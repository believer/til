<h1>today i learned</h1>

<p>Here are interesting things I found while browsing the web. It's ideas and thoughts, new findings, and reminders regarding software development. I see it as a second brain for all things related to development and a way for me to practice <a href="/posts/learning-in-public">Learning in public</a>.</p>

<p>This page is heavily inspired by Lee Byron's <a href="https://leebyron.com/til/opaque-types/">TIL</a> and builds on top of my initial attempt with my <a href="https://devlog.willcodefor.beer">Devlog</a> (I'm porting content from that page).</p>
